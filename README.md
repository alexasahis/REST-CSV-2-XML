# REST-CSV-tableau-automation
This is a simple Python CSV to XML, JSON &Â HTML converter.

If you are using a MAC you can simply convert a CSV to XML, JSON & HTML from terminal. MACs have already python installed.

From your terminal simply browse to your local directory in which this repository resides & simply type csv2xml -filename.csv.

That's all.

Thanks.
